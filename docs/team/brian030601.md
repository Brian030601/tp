## Overview

+ TaskLinker is a CLI-tool for university students to memorize flashcards,

  used for tracking general events in their normal and academic life.

#### Enhancements implemented
- **Calendar**
  - **What it does**: Adds, deletes, finds, and lists events and goals. 
  Handles exceptions to prevent program crash.
  - **Justification**: They are the second main component of the program. So,
  they are an integral part.
  - **Enhancements**: In v1.0, only events could be edited. In v2.0, calendar
  and the flashcards are integrated.
  - **Highlights**: The implementation took awhile as there was difficult part
  of integrating two different packages together.

### Review/mentoring contributions

+ Reviewed Duke and DukeTest
